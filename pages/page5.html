<pg>1.  Creeper, the first Virus
It is scary to acquire viruses on your computer because chances are your files and safety could be compromised. Ever wondered where it all started?
It was in 1971 that the first-ever computer virus emerged. The creators intended to experiment and analyze how it could spread across the files and computer itself. When it did, the screen showed the message: “I’m the creeper, catch if you can!”
Once it successfully reaches one’s computer, it replicates itself and eats the remaining memory until the computer can no longer operate due to insufficient storage.</pg>

<br>
<pg>2.     Fugaku supercomputer is the world’s fastest computer
        The Fugaku supercomputer, housed at the RIKEN Centre for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, has raised the bar for a superior computer capable of handling complicated and heavy issues and applications. The $1-billion supercomputer has 7,630,848 cores, requires 29,899 kilowatts of electricity, and can execute 442,010 teraFLOPs.</pg>

        <br>
<br>
<pg>3.     Google uses 1,000 computers in 0.2 seconds
In order to fully execute this, Google, like most search engines, relies on automated programs known as spiders or crawlers to assist them in creating search results.</pg>
         <br>  
        <br>
        <br>
     <pg>   4.     The first-ever computer had a weight of over 27 Tons
The first programmable and digital computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was developed in 1945.</pg>
